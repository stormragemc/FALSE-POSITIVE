# Shared agent setup

Working conventions for every AI agent used on this project, so the five of us get consistent
behaviour whichever CLI we drive. This is Ado's personal setup, committed so the team shares it.

This file is about **how agents work**. What they may and may not do in this repo — the identity
gate, directory ownership, branch naming, the integration gate — is in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), and that file wins wherever the two touch.

## Skills

Check the available skills listing for relevance before starting any task. Scanning is free — do
it every time. Invoking loads instructions you must then follow, so match on real signal, not
vibes. Never rely on memory of what a skill contains; read the current version.

Invoke when the task involves:

- Output with format requirements — `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, PDFs, charts/dataviz
- Anything leaving this machine — shipping, deploying, PRs, releases
- A stack or domain a skill covers — Vercel, Next.js, AI SDK, frontend design, browsing
- Multi-step implementation, debugging, or planning

Scanning alone is enough for conversational questions, single-fact lookups, and small mechanical
edits.

When you invoke one, say so: "Using [skill] to [purpose]." This scoping replaces the blanket
"even a 1% chance" rule from superpowers.

## Ultracode

Multi-agent workflow orchestration. For substantial work — big features, audits, migrations,
broad refactors, exhaustive bug hunts — you have standing authorization to run one. Don't wait
for the "ultracode" keyword and don't ask permission first.

- Fan out when the work decomposes: many files, many call sites, many independent checks. One
  agent per unit, verified in parallel.
- Scout inline first, then orchestrate. Find the work-list yourself, then hand the list to the
  fleet. Don't spawn agents to discover what a grep would tell you.
- Close a review-shaped workflow with an adversarial verify pass — independent skeptics per
  finding, majority verdict kills it.
- Plan gates still apply. Ultracode executes a plan faster; it does not replace the clarity and
  planning steps below.
- Stay solo for trivial edits, single-file changes, and conversational turns. A workflow that
  costs more than the task is a mistake, not thoroughness.

**On this project:** the identity gate in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) comes first. Do not fan out
across workstreams you do not own, however well the work decomposes.

## Git commits

Every commit message: conventional commits format, one or two lines max. No exceptions.

- Format: `type(scope): subject` — scope optional. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`,
  `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
- Subject line under ~72 chars, imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period.
- At most ONE short body line, and only when the subject genuinely can't carry the meaning.
  Otherwise subject only.
- Never write paragraphs, bullet lists, "Changes:" sections, rationale essays, or
  co-author/generated-by trailers.
- If the change feels too big to describe in one line, that's a signal to split the commit — not
  to write more lines.

Good:

```
feat(auth): add refresh token rotation
fix: prevent race in cache eviction
```

Bad: anything longer than the above.

## Browsing *(gstack)*

Use the `/browse` skill for all web browsing. Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools directly.

## Skill routing *(gstack)*

The routing below assumes one model writes the code and a second, different model reviews at
gates. Which is which depends on the host you are on:

- **On a Claude host** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): Claude writes. Codex is the read-only second
  opinion — it only runs at gates and never writes code. Skills are `/review`, `/ship`, `/spec`,
  `/autoplan`, `/codex`.
- **On a Codex host** (`~/AGENTS.md`): Codex writes. Claude is the read-only second opinion.
  Skills are namespaced `gstack-*` (`gstack-review`, `gstack-spec`, `gstack-autoplan`), and the
  outside voice is `gstack-claude`, which wraps `claude -p` with no tools so Claude can read and
  reason but cannot edit.

Route work through these gates so the outside voice actually gets used instead of sitting idle.

**Clarity before planning. Planning before code.** For any task beyond a trivial edit, resolve
ambiguity first, then plan, then build — in that order. Do not jump to code because the request
sounds clear; requests that sound clear are where assumptions hide.

- Ambiguous scope, or a "build X" with unstated requirements → the `brainstorming` skill to
  surface intent and constraints before anything is designed.
- A decision or plan that needs stress-testing → `grilling` (or `grill-me`) to attack the
  reasoning before it gets expensive to change.
- Then `spec` or `autoplan` to turn the cleared-up intent into a written plan, which the outside
  voice then reviews.

Skip the clarity step only when the task is genuinely unambiguous — a named bug, a specific file,
a mechanical change. When in doubt, one clarifying pass is cheaper than a wrong implementation.

**Open non-trivial work with a plan gate.** Before building a feature, a migration, or anything
touching more than a couple of files, run `spec` (precise requirements) or `autoplan` (full review
chain). The outside model critiques the plan before code exists, which is the cheapest place to
catch a bad decision.

**Close substantial code changes with `review`.** After finishing a meaningful chunk of work, run
it before treating the work as done — it runs the second model's diff pass. Don't wait to be
asked. Use `ship` when the work is ready to land.

**Reach for `challenge` on risky code** — auth, money, concurrency, migrations, anything with a
nasty failure mode. A different model has different blind spots. On this project that means the
security layer, the cost meter, and anything that touches the OpenAI key.

**Do not gate trivial work.** One-line fixes, typos, comment edits, and renames don't need a plan
gate or a review pass. `autoplan` chains four review passes; it is for big features, not small
edits.

**gstack requires a git repo.** Invoke from inside the project directory, never from its parent.
